          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead">This is a Practice Data Story for my Crash data problem, Problem 1B. It includes elements from our build 5C.</p>

          <p>The question that we chose to answer was “Which Hartford corridors have had the most crashes, by type, in recent years?” This question is important to many people in the Hartford community. To Trinity students, just last spring a student was killed due to reckless driving along Hartford corridors (simply; streets, roads, avenues), so this issue hits them on a personal level. To the greater Hartford community, it is important to display this information in a meaningful way to make people more aware about which corridors are more dangerous and then identifying those dangerous corridors in order to find solutions to make them safer. A town not too far from Hartford, in fact it was West Hartford, had citizens voicing their opinions about the traffic safety of the town to their town hall before putting enough pressure to force more traffic measures like adding accesible pedestrain signals and pledging money to study the traffic data more in depthly. You can read more about the incident that lead to this change and the steps the people took to voice their concerns <a href='https://www.ctinsider.com/news/article/West-Hartford-pedestrian-safety-17478465.php'>'I’m going to die right now': Why West Hartford pedestrians feel unsafe and how town is responding</a>.

          <p>Simply looking at a map showing the locations of crashes in Hartford may give you a partial view into where crashes occur most frequently. A general map of the crashes isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it does not tell an accurate or complete story. Using data from the UConn Connecticut Crash Data Repository, we are using the police crash reports from 2018-2022 to take that dimensional, spatial data of crash occurrences and assign them to their respective streets. From there, we can look at the amount of crashes on a specific street and then make stronger relationships for the data like percentages of a designated injury type on certain streets and crashes when adjusted for corridor length (distance of entire corridor).</p>

          <h2>Major Observations</h2>
          <p class="lead">Major Observation 1: Main St. has the most crashes out of any street, but may not be the most dangerous.</p>
          <p>From the initial data gathering, Main Street in Hartford had the highest number of crashes and crash related injuries from 2018-2022, with 1,153 individual incidents and 387 injuries. Yet, does this mean that Main Street is the most dangerous corridor for crashes? To answer that question we need to put our data into context. Right off the bat you may notice that the name “Main Street” denotes its centrality in Hartford, likely with high volumes of traffic and activity. This can be seen by Figure 1 below which highlights the stark number of crashes by injury type that occur in Main Street alone vs every other corrdor in Hartford. This difference is eye-popping but we will see later that while this chart is true, it is also very misleading and not the entire story. </p>

As mentioned before, Main Street has by far the most crashes and is the only corridor with over 1,000 crashes. We can also notice that for every street, a majority of their crashes involved no injuries and almost no injuries were fatal. We can now expand on these observations and see if we normalize the data, will Main Steet still be the most dangerous corridor? </p>

          <h4>Works Cited:</h4>

          <p>Walsh, Michael. “‘I’m Going to Die Right Now’: Why West Hartford Pedestrians Feel Unsafe and How Town Is Responding.” CT Insider, 3 Oct. 2022. <a href='https://www.ctinsider.com/news/article/West-Hartford-pedestrian-safety-17478465.php'>https://www.ctinsider.com/news/article/West-Hartford-pedestrian-safety-17478465.php</a>.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
            overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
          .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
            font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
          .tg .tg-lqy6{text-align:right;vertical-align:top}
          .tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
          .tg .tg-dvpl{border-color:inherit;text-align:right;vertical-align:top}
          </style>
          <table class="tg">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header A</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header B</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header C</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">987</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">654</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">321</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
          </table>
